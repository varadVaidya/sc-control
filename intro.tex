\textit{Disclaimer:} This document will inevitably contain some mistakesâ€” both
simple typos and legitimate errors. Keep in mind that these are the notes of a graduate student in the process of learning the material himself, so take
what you read with a grain of salt. If you find mistakes and feel like telling
me, I will be grateful and happy to hear from you, even for the most trivial of
errors. You can reach me by email at
