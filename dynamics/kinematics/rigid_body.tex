\subsection{Rigid Body Kineamtics}
Kinematics means to study the description of motion of the body.

Attitude coordinates are set of coordinates hat describe attitude of body and/or a reference frame.

% make a list
\begin{itemize}
	\item \(\infty \) number of attitude coordinates choice exists.
	\item good choice \(\to\) simplifies the maths of the problem.
	\item bad choice \(\to\) introduces singularities and adds non-linear maths to the problem
\end{itemize}

A minimum of 3 coordinates are required to describe the orientation of a rigid body in space, or describe the relative angular displacement between two frames. But, any set of three coordinates will contain atleast one geometrical orientation where the coordinates are singular i.e. atleast two coordinates are undefined or not unique. At or near such a geometric singularity, the corresponding kinematic differential equations are also singular. Such geometric singularities and associated numerical difficulties can be avoided altogether through regularization. Redundant sets of four ot more coordinates exist that are universally valid.
